# BSportfolio
portfolio w bootstrap

For this portfolio, I started with the bootstrap navbars and tried formatting them to get them to appear as required. I used a form from bootstrap for the contact page. I was experimenting with columns and rows attempting to get the right positioning for text but I still have a lot of issues with positioning. I used a mix of external css and inline styling. I refered to several youtube videos and stackoverflow sight, w3 schools, and bootstrap site to try and get a better understanding, but the challenge is always getting it done in time.
